# Pokemon
Final Project for my First CSCI Class â€“ Turn Based, Terminal-Display Pokemon

Truth betold, the game is not the most fun nor most easy to play, however, it taught me a lot about Class-based C++ programming, and how multiple files must work together such that not everything is cramped on a single .cpp file, thus using .h files for the first time efficiently. Compile using the unityP3.cpp file, I received a 100% for the code and interview portion of the project.
